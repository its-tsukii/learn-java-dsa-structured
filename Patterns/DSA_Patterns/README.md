# Introduction

## This is a Sub-directory dedicated to a structured learning pattern wise (Note : Not the System Design Patterns Rather the Question Solving Dsa Patterns )

### These Include Patters

* 1.Array Patterns(40-50):

  * Two Pointers
  * Sliding Window
  * Prefix Sum
  * Kandane's Algorithm

* 2.Binary Search Variants(25-30) :

  * Basic Binary Search On Sorted Array
  * Search on Rotated Arrays
  * Binary Search on Answer
  * Lower Bound/ Upper Bound Style

* 3.Sorting + Greedy(20-25) :

  * Interval Scheduling
  * Activity Selection
  * Minimum Platforms
    -Greedy with Heaps (Huffman Coding, Task Scheduler)

* 4.LinkedList(20) :

  * Reverse LinkedList (Iterative + Recursive)
  * Detect Cycle (Floyd's Algorithm)
  * Merge Two Sorted Lists
  * Copy List With Random Pointer
  * LRU cache (Design Pattern Problem)

* 5.Stacks & Queues (MonoTonic Structures) (20-25):
  * Valid Parentheses / min Stack
  * Next Greater element / Next Smaller element
  * Sliding window maximum (deque)
  * Histogram max area / Max rectangle in binary matrix

* 6.Binary Trees & BST (30-35):
  * DFS traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  * BFS traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
  * Lowest Common Ancestor
  * Diameter of binary tree
  * Balanced BST, BST validation, kth Samllest
  * Serialize/ Deserialize binary tree

* 7.Graphs(40-50):
  * BFS/ DFS (Matrix and adjacency List)
  * Topological sort (Kahn's + DFS)
  * Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
  * Union-Find (disjoint sets, Kruskal's)
  * Connected componenets, bipartite check
  * Minimum spanning tree (Prim's/ Kruskal's)

* 8.Dynamic Programming ðŸ«¡ (60-70):
  * 1D
  * 2D
  * Subset/ KnapSack Versions
  * Dp on Strings
  * Dp on subsequences
  * Dp on partitions
  * Dp on trees/ graphs

* 9.Heap/ Priority QUeue (15):
  * Kth Largest/ Smallest Element
  * merge k sorted lists arrays
  * median in data stream

* 10.Hashing/ Strings (20-25):

  * Anagrams
  * Longest Substring without repeat
  * rabin-karp /Kmp (Pattern matching)
  * trie-based (word dictionary, prefix queries)

* 11.Design / OOP - style (10-15):

  * LRU cache, LFU cache
  * Design Twitter / TinyURL
  * Rate Limiter, Hit Counter

## Priority wise

* this includes the same pattern but priority wise also sort of an structure for the interviews

* ### Tier 1 (Highest Priority) (150) :  Must-do ASAP

  * Arrays & Strings (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, prefix sum, Hashing)
  * Binary Search + Binary Search on Answer
  * Linked Lists Basics (Reverse, Cycle detection, merge)
  * Stack/ Queue (Valid Parentheses, Next Greater, Sliding Window Max)
  * Trees (Traversals, LCA, Diameter)
  * Graphs (BFS, DFS, Topological sort, Shortest path basics)
  * DP baiscs (fibonacci, knapsack, LIS, grid paths, LCS)

* ### Tier 2 (Medium Priority) (120) : These are Often 2nd-3rd round questions
  
  * Greedy (Intervals, Scheduling, Merge Intervals)
  * Heap/ PQ (kth largest, merge k lists, median stream)
  * Advanced Tree (BST validation, serialize/deserialize)
  * Union-Find (Disjoint set, Kruskal)
  * DP on subsequence/ Strings (edit distance, palindromes, partitions)

* ### Tier 3 (Lowest Priority) (120) : These are just confidence booster questions

  * Advanced DP (matrix chain, burst balloons, DP on trees)
  * Advanced Graph (min spanning tree, max flow, bipartite check)
  * Tries (Prefix Search, word dictionary)
  * Design Problems (LRU cache, rate limiter, TinyUrl)
