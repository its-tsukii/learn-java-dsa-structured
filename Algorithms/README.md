# Algorithms

This folder contains implementations, explanations, complexity analyses, and benchmarking for a variety of algorithms.

## Structure

- Subfolders are organized by algorithm type (e.g., Searching, Sorting, Graph, DynamicProgramming).
- Each subfolder contains:
  - Java source code for each algorithm.
  - A README with algorithm explanations, complexity analysis, and sample outputs.
  - Benchmarking results (where available).

## How to Use

- Browse to the subfolder of interest.
- Each README gives a high-level overview and links to the source files.
- Run the Java files to see benchmarks and outputs.

## Example Subfolders

- `Searching/`
- `Sorting/`
- `Graph/`
- `DynamicProgramming/`
