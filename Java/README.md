# üß† Java for FAANG Interview Preparation

This repository serves as a structured guide to mastering **Java** for cracking **FAANG-level interviews**. It is divided into two parts:

- [`CoreJava/`](Java/Core/) ‚Äì Focused on data structures, algorithms, and OOP.
- [AdvancedJava](Java/Advanced) ‚Äì Focused on system design, backend development, and scalable architecture.

- Control flow: if-else, loops, switch
- Type casting

#### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Encapsulation, Abstraction
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes

#### 3. Collections Framework

- List, Set, Map, Queue
- ArrayList vs LinkedList
- HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
- HashSet vs TreeSet
- Stack, Queue, PriorityQueue
- Iterator, Comparable vs Comparator

#### 4. Exception Handling

- try-catch-finally
- throw vs throws
- Custom exceptions

#### 5. Java Memory & Multithreading Basics

- Stack vs Heap
- Garbage collection
- Threads and Runnables
- Synchronization, volatile, deadlocks

#### 6. Input/Output

- FileReader, BufferedReader, Scanner
- Serialization and Deserialization

#### 7. Java 8 Features (Must-Know)

- Lambda expressions
- Functional interfaces
- Stream API
- Optional
- Method references

- IoC and Dependency Injection
- REST APIs and Controllers
- Spring Data JPA (CRUD, Repositories)
- Exception handling
- Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2)
- Unit testing (JUnit, Mockito)
- YAML configuration

#### 5. Hibernate / JPA

- Entity mapping
- OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany
- Lazy vs Eager loading
- JPQL basics

#### 6. Microservices Architecture

- RESTful services and API Gateway
- Eureka Service Registry
- Feign Clients, gRPC
- Circuit Breakers (Resilience4j)
- Docker (basic containerization)
- Kubernetes (optional)

#### 7. Design Patterns (For LLD/System Design)
