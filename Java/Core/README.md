a constructor cannot return a value, syntax : public Constructor(){}, a constructor is required to be public

abstraction uses a extends feature and interface uses a implements feature , we use extends with threads and implements with runnables and callables
in both abstraction and interface we just define the function there but not the code block we define it elsewhere in another class
we can also define the function inside of the abstract with code block but its better to define them outside or define one inside and one half there half somewhere else

encapsulation helps with security like setting the variables private and then having a way to access them via getter and setters , why encapsulation : this helps with data integrity and serves as a flow of variables
why abstraction or interface : this serves as a blueprint it helps in pure abstraction like we only define a func in abstract or interface but the code somewhere else which helps with hiding the code logic 

in methodoverloading we basically overload the methods that we create different methods of the same name and the language dynamically uses the apropritate method such as one method add takes in int x and another method add takes in double x ... while calling if we use int it access add with int if we use double it access the add with double
