## ---- Important Or Algorithms that cover 90% or more questions or interview - favorite

                    --> MergeSort - covers 90% of the interview questions on sorting
    1.Sorting -->  
                    --> QuickSort - Closely Follows MergeSort But MergeSort Stil Dominates

                    --> Some Questions still requires BucketSort but its not worth the trouble

                                    -->BinarySearch On Questions - basic binary questions
    2.Searching --> BinarySearch 
                                    -->BinarySearch On Answers - such as koko banana question
